# Fortune 500 Email Domains

Here you'll find a list of email domains associated with Fortune 500 companies. 

## Why? 
When managing a CRM, CDP, or marketing automation platform it's important to map email addresses to associated companies. All companies in the Fortune 500 use multiple domains in their business operations, and it can be difficult to accurately associate email domains to the parent company. We hope this list will help! You can learn more about [how we created this list](https://www.gigasheet.com/post/fortune-500-email-list "Fortune 500 Email List"), and how to use it in [Gigasheet](https://www.gigasheet.com/ "Big Data Spreasheet") to clean up data.
