# fortune-500-domains

Here you'll find a list of email domains associated with Fortune 500 companies. Why? When managing a CRM, CDP, or marketing automation platform it's important to map email addressess to associated companies. All companies in the Fortune 500 use multiple domains in their business operations, and it can be difficult to accurately map their email domains to the parent company. We hope this list will help! You can learn more about how we created this list, and how to use it in Gigasheet to clean up data: https://www.gigasheet.com/post/fortune-500-email-list
